        <p class="text-4xl font-bold drop-shadow-none">Why Developer Velocity Is not That Important</p>
        <p class="w-2/3 text-xl mt-10 text-left leading-normal font-light"> Recently i came across a video when i was casually strolling through youtube.
            The video compared the most popular languages like Golang, Rust, Typescript, Javascript. The point of developer velocity was brought up multiple times.
            Now, i am quite new to the Web Development World and haven't worked on many Large projects. But i will be bringing my own perspective to this discussion.
        </p>
        <p class="w-2/3 text-xl mt-10 text-left leading-normal font-light">
            My main problem with the current ecosystem is the extensive use of javascript and typescript in areas that not well suited for the these languages, like Backend Development.
            While i am extremely happy with how the industry has developed the web platform to the point where we can write a gui application once and run it anywhere. we have also written a lot of shitty code which dosen't even run smoothly on modern hardware.
            I have enjoyed the "Developer velocity" in writing a gui in HTML and JS quickly for my Projects but I believe that for more business side logic we should be willing to sacrifice the developer velocity in exchange for more performant and safe alternatives.
        </p>
        <p class="w-2/3 text-xl mt-10 text-left leading-normal font-light">
            Not Every app should be written in C, C++ or Rust and not every app should be Written in JS. I personally am a Rust fanboy, but i think GoLang fits the perfect spot for our performance along with developer velocity.
            Now Go is not a be all and end all of this conversation, There are a few caveats with it. <br>
            <ol class="w-2/3 p-1 font-light">
            <li class="p-1"> 1) EveryThing is Mutable in Go, This is not a safe for multiple reasons which will not be discussed here. </li>
            <li class="p-1"> 2) The infamous nil pointer Error </li>
            <li class="p-1"> 3) Confusing Package Manager for non stadard packages/library {Might be a Skill Issue from my side} </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p class="w-2/3 text-xl mt-10 text-left leading-normal font-light">
            I personally enjoy writing rust and python for backends but for web related Platforms Go is good a language. <br>
            While developer velocity is Important in the early days of a service/app, i believe Quality is more important specially for the backend.
            As the service has to reliable in its early days.
            I am not telling you to go and write a backend in C and then fail to even make a working prototype. i am telling you to not use JS everywhere.
        </p>
        <p class="w-2/3 text-xl mt-10 text-left leading-normal font-light">
            Go outside your comofort zone and explore, it will help you write better code and improve your "Velocity" While also building better apps.
